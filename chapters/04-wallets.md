# Wallets

Wallets are essential tools for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. They allow users to securely store, send, and receive ALPH tokens, as well as interact with smart contracts and participate in network activities. This chapter explores the fundamentals of Alephium wallets, types of wallets available, and how to use them effectively.

## What is an Alephium Wallet?

An Alephium wallet is a digital tool that enables users to manage their ALPH tokens and other assets on the Alephium blockchain. A wallet doesn’t store tokens directly but instead manages the private keys required to access and control funds on the blockchain.

- **Private Key:** A secret code that grants access to funds. It must be kept secure.

- **Public Key:** Derived from the private key, it is used to generate wallet addresses.

- **Wallet Address:** The public-facing identifier where others can send ALPH tokens.

## Types of Wallets

Alephium supports various wallet types to cater to different user preferences and security needs:

### Software Wallets

Software wallets are applications that run on devices such as computers and smartphones. They are user-friendly and suitable for most users.

- **Desktop Wallets:** Installed on personal computers, offering enhanced control and features.

- **Mobile Wallets:** Convenient for on-the-go transactions via smartphones.

- **Extension Wallets:** Available as browser extensions, providing easy access to the blockchain.
